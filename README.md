# R/P/S CLI game

## Run the game

Once you've cloned a project install cargo cli if not installed, then run

```bash
cargo run your_guess
```

You should change `your_guess` to either Rock, Paper or Scissors (not case sensetive). Or you can write whatever you want, I made an error handling you little hacker !

## Test the game

If for whatever reason you want to test my project then run

```bash
cargo test
```
